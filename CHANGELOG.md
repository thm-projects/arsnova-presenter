# Changelog

## 1.1.1
This release introduces the following changes:
* Fixes error handling and validation for session updates
* Fixes session creation proposal dialog
* Improves localization and adds missing strings

## 1.1.0
This version introduces editing support. You can now create, update and delete
sessions and questions in ARSnova Presenter. Furthermore, support for
Just-in-Time-Teaching has been implemented which allows you to define questions
to be answered before lecture. To keep the user interface clean and only show
the functionality needed when presenting, you can switch between
different modes for these tasks.

The full list of changes:
* Internationalization: The user interface is now translatable (currently
  English and German are supported). Your language is missing? We would be happy
  to receive your pull request.
* Accessibility: Presenter is now completely usable via keyboard.
* Exporting: Sessions and questions can be exported to JSON format.
* A lot of usability improvements, bug fixes and changes under the hood (see
  [commit log](https://github.com/thm-projects/arsnova-presenter/compare/v1.0.7...v1.1.0)).

## 1.0
The initial version of ARSnova Presenter was developed by Daniel Gerhardt as
project for his bachelor thesis.
